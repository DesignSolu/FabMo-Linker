FabMo Linker
===========

## Introduction
This github repository contains the source, binaries and documentation for the FabMo Linker.

## What is the FabMo Linker ?
The FabMo Linker is an app that can run on devices from a Windows, Linux or MAC PC to smart phones and tablets running iOS or Android.
This application makes the link between job-oriented web apps and the machine.
It provides the user with a simply and efficient way to  :
 * find and make a connection to a tool
 * configure, manage and supervise their tool(s)
 * download, install and run Apps.

**We know that there is a lot of work to do on it**

The current version includes the detection tool that allows apps to comunicate with the tool without any configuration (using the FabMo.js library). Our primary focus is on providing web developers with all that they need to start developing their apps.

Here is a concept of our final goal :
